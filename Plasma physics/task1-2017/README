This directory contains a first examples for programming tasks for
FYS-2006 fall 2017

The file ode_ExB contains a function implementing the equations of
motion (three coupled second order ordinary differential equations) in
a format (6 coupled first-order differential equations) suitable for
the ode-integrating functions of matlab, the purpose of the file is
to illustrate how a well-written matlab-function should look in terms
of documentation and commenting. Similar programming styles should be
used regardless of programming language chosen for the programming
tasks. Changes should be made to fit the help/documentation formats at
hand, but all the pieces should be there in some order: calling
syntax, description of input and output parameters, preferably an
illustrating example of usage and description of methods and algorithms.

The script ExB_drift_example.m uses the format of commenting
that in matlab parlance is known as "cell-mode" which makes it
possible to evaluate the script section-by-section and also
automatically generate html or latex-documents of the script. The
sections/cells are started with a '%%' followed by a section header.

There are several cheat-sheets listing many useful matlab-functions
and commands available on the internet. 

As to style of programming - there are likewise several sources for
style-guides available on the internet, find some use them - but do
not become prisoner of the rules laid out.
